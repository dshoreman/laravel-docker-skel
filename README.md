# Laravel Docker Skeleton

A skeleton repo for starting a fresh Laravel app with Docker.

It builds on PHP7-fpm-alpine, adding essentials such as the MySQL PDO extension.

## Getting started

This is meant as a quick start for a fresh Dockerised Laravel app.

To get started, clone/fork this repo somewhere, `cd` to it then run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now open http://localhost:8080 in a browser.
